/*! @brief Sets the refresh callback for the specified window.
 *
 *  This function sets the refresh callback of the specified window, which is
 *  called when the client area of the window needs to be redrawn, for example
 *  if the window has been exposed after having been covered by another window.
 *
 *  On compositing window systems such as Aero, Compiz or Aqua, where the window
 *  contents are saved off-screen, this callback may be called only very
 *  infrequently or never at all.
 *
 *  @param[in] window The window whose callback to set.
 *  @param[in] cbfun The new callback, or `NULL` to remove the currently set
 *  callback.
 *  @return The previously set callback, or `NULL` if no callback was set or an
 *  error occurred.
 *
 *  @note On compositing window systems such as Aero, Compiz or Aqua, where the
 *  window contents are saved off-screen, this callback may be called only very
 *  infrequently or never at all.
 *
 *  @ingroup window

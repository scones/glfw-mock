/*! @brief Sets the mouse button callback.
 *
 *  This function sets the mouse button callback of the specified window, which
 *  is called when a mouse button is pressed or released.
 *
 *  When a window loses focus, it will generate synthetic mouse button release
 *  events for all pressed mouse buttons.  You can tell these events from
 *  user-generated events by the fact that the synthetic ones are generated
 *  after the window has lost focus, i.e. `GLFW_FOCUSED` will be false and the
 *  focus callback will have already been called.
 *
 *  @param[in] window The window whose callback to set.
 *  @param[in] cbfun The new callback, or `NULL` to remove the currently set
 *  callback.
 *  @return The previously set callback, or `NULL` if no callback was set or an
 *  error occurred.
 *
 *  @ingroup input

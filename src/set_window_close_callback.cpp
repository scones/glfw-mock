/*! @brief Sets the close callback for the specified window.
 *
 *  This function sets the close callback of the specified window, which is
 *  called when the user attempts to close the window, for example by clicking
 *  the close widget in the title bar.
 *
 *  The close flag is set before this callback is called, but you can modify it
 *  at any time with @ref glfwSetWindowShouldClose.
 *
 *  The close callback is not triggered by @ref glfwDestroyWindow.
 *
 *  @param[in] window The window whose callback to set.
 *  @param[in] cbfun The new callback, or `NULL` to remove the currently set
 *  callback.
 *  @return The previously set callback, or `NULL` if no callback was set or an
 *  error occurred.
 *
 *  @remarks **Mac OS X:** Selecting Quit from the application menu will
 *  trigger the close callback for all windows.
 *
 *  @ingroup window

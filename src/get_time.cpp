/*! @brief Returns the value of the GLFW timer.
 *
 *  This function returns the value of the GLFW timer.  Unless the timer has
 *  been set using @ref glfwSetTime, the timer measures time elapsed since GLFW
 *  was initialized.
 *
 *  @return The current value, in seconds, or zero if an error occurred.
 *
 *  @remarks This function may be called from secondary threads.
 *
 *  @note The resolution of the timer is system dependent, but is usually on the
 *  order of a few micro- or nanoseconds.  It uses the highest-resolution
 *  monotonic time source on each supported platform.
